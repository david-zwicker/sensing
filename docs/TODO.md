* Primacy coding:
    - add some tests to ensure that setting coding_receptors works as intended
    - add numba code for sped up version of the module
* Think about estimating/calculating mixture entropy for continuous mixtures
* Think about implementing the sped up version of the mutual information
    calculation for correlated mixtures by representing the concentration
    vector by the indices of the ligands that are present
