* Think about estimating/calculating mixture entropy for continuous mixtures
* Think about implementing the sped up version of the mutual information
    calculation for correlated mixtures by representing the concentration
    vector by the indices of the ligands that are present
* distribute saved optimization values logarithmically
* develop a stopping criterion for the descent optimization algorithm
    1) no improvement after 50% (or any other number) of the matrix entries tested
